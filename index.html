		    	<h2>What is AA?</h2>
		        <blockquote>Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.</blockquote>
		        <h2>What is Intergroup?</h2>
		        <blockquote>Intergroup is a local AA service office, established and supported by AA groups and members, to help carry the AA message within the Savannah Area. It is a partnership of AA groups just as an AA group is a partnership of individuals. The Intergroup maintains a telephone help-line available to the public; to anyone in the community who may have a problem with alcohol.</blockquote>

		        <blockquote>The Intergroup office relies on AA group members to perform 12 Step service. Service at the Intergroup office generally consists of answering the Intergroup phone, arranging AA member 12 step calls for newcomers, helping callers get to meetings, and being available to supply literature to the groups. Intergroup publishes a local meeting list, newsletters, and a website which contains meeting schedules. There is also literature and pamphlets available at the Intergroup office.</blockquote>
